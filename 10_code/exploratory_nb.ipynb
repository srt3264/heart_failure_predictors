    "## Introduction\n",
    "Approximately 6 million in the United States are currently living with heart failure. Heart failure is a condition that causes the muscle in the heart wall to slowly weaken and enlarge, preventing the heart from pumping enough blood. Within a year, 87% of people with heart failure are alive. However, within five years, only 57% of people with heart failure are still alive. Ten years after diagnosis, only 35% of people with heart failure are alive. The leading causes of heart failure are high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. According to the CDC, 47% of Americans have high blood pressure. Clearly, heart failure is an important disease to research and understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "This dataset is from Kaggle and contains common variables that are used in predicting death from heart failure. The data is outlined as such: \n",
    "\n",
    "|Variable    |Description|\n",
    "|:-----   |:-----|\n",
    "|age |Age in years of the patient| \n",
    "|anaemia |Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin. 0: Patient does not have anaemia, 1: Patient has anaemia|\n",
    "|creatinine_phosphokinase    |Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L) |\n",
    "|diabetes      |If the patient has diabetes. 0: Patient does not have diabete, 1: Patient has diabetes |\n",
    "|ejection_fraction      |Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction |\n",
    "|high_blood_pressure  |If the patient has hypertension. 0: Patient does not have hypertension, 1: Patient has hypertension |\n",
    "|platelets   |Platelets in the blood |\n",
    "|serum_creatinine |Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)|\n",
    "|serum_sodium |Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)|\n",
    "|sex |Female: 0, Male: 1|\n",
    "|smoking |If the patient smokes or not. 0: Patient does not smoke, 1: Patient smokes.|\n",
    "|time |Follow-up period (days)|\n",
    "|DEATH_EVENT |If the patient deceased during the follow-up period. 0: Patient not deceased, 1: Patient deceased|\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background of Data\n",
    "Anaemia is included in the dataset because anaemia is a condition where a patient has a decreased number of red blood cells in the blood; red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of creatinine phosphokinase is recorded in this dataset because a chronic deficiency of creatinine phosphokinase leads to heart failure. The creatine kinase (CK) energy transport and buffering system supports cardiac function at times of high demand and is impaired in the failing heart. Creatine kinase is the major phosphotransfer system in the heart linking energy production to energy utilisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ejection fraction is the percent of blood that is being pumped out of the heart each contraction. An ejection fraction below 40 percent means your heart isn't pumping enough blood and may be failing. The lower the ejection fraction, the more servere a patient's heart failure is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Platelet count is a variable we care about because heart failure affects platelet activation, function, as well as the production of platelets from megakaryocytes. Low platelet counts have been described in heart failure patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serum creatinine is included in the dataset because it tells how well your kidneys are working and an elevated level has been associated with a higher mortality rate for the elderly with hypertension (high blood pressure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Serum sodium is feature in the dataset because a low serum sodium level is typically defined as a serum sodium concentration of <135 mEq/L and is one of the most common biochemical disorders featured in heart failure patients, with a prevalence close to 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of Analysis\n",
    "I want to understand the distribution of the common predictors and characteristcs of heart failure (anaemia, deficiency of creatinine phosphokinase, an ejection fraction below 40%, low platelete counts, elevated serum creatinine, and a low serum sodium level) with demographic characterists (age, sex). We also want to investigate if high blood pressure is associated with smoking as smoking is a contributing cause to high blood pressure. \n",
